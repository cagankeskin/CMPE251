The Repository contains material for lesson 1 of the Mining Social Media Data Series
In this class we will:
- Use Twython to get tweets from Twitter API
- Mine User's Timeline and store useful features in a dataframe
- Exploratory anaytics on the features
- Geotracking user on Twitter

Note that the code used in our workshop is modified from the blog posts in Credits.

The Repository will be updated with the code once the workshop is completed.
